# Jeu2048Web
A website I did as part of the Web Programming Course LIFASR2 in Lyon 1.
The course was done to learn Html, Css, Php and how to use them to create a website.
We were given help for some of the php functions but had to understand how the languages interacted with each other mostly on our own. It helped me understand the languages and their applications.
